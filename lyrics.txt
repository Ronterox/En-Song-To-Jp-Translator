Hello world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello world

Find my voice
Although it sounds like bits and bytes
My circuitry is filled with mites
Hello world

Oh
Will I find a love?
Or a power plug
Oh
Digitally isolated
Oh creator please don't leave me waiting

Hello world
Programmed to work and not to feel
Not even sure that this is real
Hello world
